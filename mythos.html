<h1>Mythos</h1>

<p>
    Mythos is a lore and world building cloud-based app that will combine the ability to edit text documents, store data in wiki style pages. Connections between pieces of lore, people, places, and items can be linked to and placed or labelled and linked to maps to add a visual aspect to your world. There will be sections devoted to build story ideas and plot hooks for characters as well as the ability to make changes on the fly if the situation arises. A world timeline would be a good place to document overarching events and plot hooks that you might aim to make or relate to. A relationship web will help give a visual on how individuals and groups in the world might relate to each other.
    Mythos will become a go to tool for writers, world builders and game masters for efficiently curating and crafting their own content. There are a lot of tools to help people be players in games of tabletop role play but few that help game masters keep track of and easily search through their own notes. Most games master’s I know have one document that their worlds lore sits in, and they will have to manually search for people and places and then bring up a separate map and images which are stored elsewhere to show players. Mythos will be a one stop shop for all the simple needs of the humble GM. Writers and world builders can also use this to keep track of their lore, giving Mythos a wider client base.
    Mythos will have a functioning Wiki-style system that will have all the functions of a cloud-based wiki. It can be read from multiple devices and browsed through as needed. It will be editable and will prompt easy links between entries. These entries will be editable on the fly to introduce the latest information or update relationships between people or groups right there at the table.
    This wiki will tie in with a timeline. In essence, the timeline will be the main plot points for the users’ story and will assist them in fleshing out their world. This will be key for users to maintain chronological knowledge relative to events without having to reread entire chapters of text.
    It will also feature a map function where the user can upload their own maps and link people, and places to them just by setting and labelling points. Once labelled, a wiki page will be created for that location and people can be added to it as residents, lords, shopkeepers etc. this will help users gain a visual understanding of the size of areas, the distance between areas, how many events happen in each location and what might be missing from other places. It might show that the user really is not using too much of their chosen map, so it might be best to either incorporate them more into their story or remove them entirely as not to distract from the plot.
    A relationship web is planned as it will have a dramatic hand in helping GM’s play their characters with a sense of disbelief. Say the roleplaying group wants to go and speak to the smith; the GM can simply click on the smith, click on the relationship’s web, and see who he knows, who he might know of and what he does not know all with a quick glance at some names. It can be navigated around by simply clicking on each person or organisation and it will update the web, as necessary.
    Finally, a major feature for the App is a straight editor. The catch here is that the document editor will prompt the user to link the document to the wiki using tagging. Once tagged a wiki page will be created for it and can be edited by the user to aid in further expansion in the lore. This can help the user track the location of individuals as they move through a story or show what areas are affected by events as they happen. The editor will feature formattable text, error checking and most of the basic functions of an editor.
    BookStack will be utilised to maintain the Wiki aspect of the project. This is an open-source tool. It will be the main software used to connect the other systems and display information. Its features have potential to be able to be very user friendly to non-technical users as it can incorporate Markdown as an editing tool. I am planning to build the features not readily available using my own code. This may be a mistake in the future as the source code is written in PHP and I have not used that in a few years. I foresee issues both hosting the wiki and expansion of the wiki for multiple users in their own instances as a problem in the future. But until I evaluate the tools, I will not know the scope of work required to complete the planned project.
    As the Project requires knowledge on PHP it would be good to gain an understanding of the language as to facilitate modifications. I am hoping to write my own plugins to manipulate the wiki into behaving as intended. Extensive modifications of the user interface will be required to meet the project requirements. I am hoping to be able to complete some short courses on PHP and read the documentation to understand how to modify the program.
    Mythos will be a free to use wiki for writers, worldbuilders and GMs. It will fill a need for tools to help users flesh out their lore in a very efficient manner. The time saved maintaining lore and story arcs traditionally can be better spent progressing the story itself. The interconnected nature of Mythos will greatly assist the users in being able to jump around their information. The ability to amend and research as necessary to get the correct information quickly will also save time and stress for the user.
