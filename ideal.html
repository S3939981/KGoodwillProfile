<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<img src="assets/images/developer.png" alt="Security Developer job listing Screen Capture">
  <h2>Security Developer</h2>
  <p>
    A Security Developer is integral to the security aspect of IT projects. This role is required to take client needs, develop a plan, explore structures necessary to complete the task and construct and install the solution. Along with maintaining existing systems and researching new processes to maintain their level of skill. It’s an interesting position because I enjoy logic and efficiency in my life, and I feel as that could be beneficial to this style of work. Constant betterment of skills to produce the best work possible.

    A person fit for this job would need at Bachelors in IT (or equivalent; Cyber Security etc) and two or three years of software development experience. Along with the skills and knowledge that comes from that experience. A healthy interpersonal skill wouldn’t go astray as this role is expected to interact with stakeholders and clients. A strong, security focused coding style is preferred along with knowledge in Python among other scripts, frameworks, automation, and monitoring skills.

    Currently I possess a Diploma of IT with no IT industry experience. However, I maintain a friendly personable nature and have lots of practice with clients in my current occupation. Management skills I possess through running my own department, although not needed for this position wouldn’t go astray either.

    I plan to complete my Bachelors in IT at RMIT and attempting to get a job at a company that has Security Developer positions, only in a more entry level role. A level one or two help desk people. I will then build that desired industry experience and rapport within said company to eventually (hopefully) end up in the role.
